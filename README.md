A web-based system that efficiently manages patient and doctor information, appointments, and diagnoses. 
It securely stores patient diagnosis information and manages doctor details, including their areas of specialization. 
The appointment feature allows patients to request appointments, and doctors can view and manage their schedules. 
The system is user-friendly, customizable, and scalable, making it a valuable tool for healthcare providers.

NOTE:
The system's UI is build on top of Django's built-in admin site. Although it is fully customised.
